# Foggy Mirror

This is a fun little experiment with HTML5 `MediaDevices` API.

In working browsers it captures video from your device camera, flips it like a mirror, and then fogs it up real good.

You _should_ be able to draw on the “mirror” with your mouse or finger and see clear video beneath.

## Set up and development

Using `yarn` as your package manager...

`yarn install` to install dependencies.

`yarn build` to do a production build

`yarn dev` to run the webpack development server.
